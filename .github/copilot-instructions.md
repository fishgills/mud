# Copilot Instructions

- Always propose commit messages using the Conventional Commits format (`<type>(scope): description`).
- Prefer descriptive types such as `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc., and include a scope when it helps (e.g., `feat(slack): add changelog blocks`).
- Avoid suggesting commit messages that do not conform to Conventional Commits.
