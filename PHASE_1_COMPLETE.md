# Phase 1: Core Engine Abstraction - Complete! 🎉

## Overview

We've successfully implemented Phase 1 of the architectural evolution to create a **client-agnostic, event-driven MUD engine** inspired by RanvierMUD's architecture.

## What Was Built

### 1. **Event System** (`libs/engine/src/events/`)

- **EventBus**: Central event dispatcher for decoupled communication
- **Game Events**: Comprehensive event types for all game actions
  - Player events (spawn, move, death, level up, party join/leave)
  - Combat events (start, hit, miss, end)
  - Monster events (spawn, move, death)
  - NPC events (dialogue, quest offers)
  - Party events (create, disband)
  - World events (weather, time tick)

```typescript
// Example usage
EventBus.on('player:move', (event) => {
  console.log(`${event.player.name} moved to ${event.toX}, ${event.toY}`);
});

await EventBus.emit({
  eventType: 'player:spawn',
  player,
  x: 10,
  y: 20,
  timestamp: new Date(),
});
```

### 2. **Entity System** (`libs/engine/src/entities/`)

Base classes for all game entities:

- **GameEntity**: Abstract base for all entities
- **Character**: Base for Player/NPC/Monster with combat, attributes, movement
- **PlayerEntity**: Human-controlled characters with XP, levels, skill points
- **MonsterEntity**: Hostile creatures with XP/gold rewards
- **NpcEntity**: Non-player characters (merchants, guards, quest givers)
- **PartyEntity**: Group gameplay management

### 3. **Factory Pattern** (`libs/engine/src/factories/`)

Factories for creating and managing entities:

- **PlayerFactory**: Create/load/save players from database
- **MonsterFactory**: Spawn monsters with templates and variance
- **NpcFactory**: Create NPCs with role-based stats (in-memory for now)
- **PartyFactory**: Manage party creation and membership

```typescript
// Example usage
const player = await PlayerFactory.create({
  clientId: 'user-123',
  clientType: 'slack',
  name: 'Hero',
  x: 0,
  y: 0,
});

const monster = await MonsterFactory.create({
  x: 10,
  y: 10,
  biomeId: 1,
  template: MonsterFactory.getTemplateByName('Goblin'),
});
```

### 4. **Behavior System** (`libs/engine/src/behaviors/`)

AI behaviors for NPCs and monsters:

- **Behavior Interface**: Pluggable behavior pattern
- **RandomMovementBehavior**: Monsters wander randomly
- **AggressiveBehavior**: Attack nearby players
- **PatrolBehavior**: NPCs patrol routes
- **BehaviorManager**: Execute behaviors based on priority

```typescript
// Example usage
const behaviorManager = new BehaviorManager();
behaviorManager.registerBehavior('monster-1', new RandomMovementBehavior());
behaviorManager.registerBehavior('monster-1', new AggressiveBehavior(2));

await behaviorManager.executeBehaviors('monster-1', {
  entity: monsterEntity,
  nearbyPlayers: [{ id: 1, name: 'Hero', distance: 1.5 }],
});
```

### 5. **Database Schema Updates**

Added new tables to Prisma schema:

- **Npc**: Non-player characters with roles, dialogue, settlements
- **Party**: Party system with leader and max size
- **PartyMember**: Many-to-many relationship between parties and players
- **Item**: Items for future inventory system
- Updated **Player** to include `partyId` relationship

## Architecture Benefits

### Client-Agnostic Design

The engine has **zero** dependencies on Slack, Discord, or any specific client. All client-specific logic will be handled by adapters:

```
@mud/engine (core logic)
    ↓
Client Adapter Interface
    ↓
┌─────────────┬──────────────┬─────────────┐
│   Slack     │   Discord    │     Web     │
│   Adapter   │   Adapter    │   Adapter   │
└─────────────┴──────────────┴─────────────┘
```

### Event-Driven Communication

- Services can subscribe to events without tight coupling
- AI descriptions can be generated asynchronously on events
- Client notifications happen via event listeners
- Easy to add new features by listening to existing events

### Factory Pattern Benefits

- Consistent entity creation logic
- Database operations centralized
- Easy to add validation and business rules
- Automatic event emission on creation

### Behavior System Advantages

- NPCs and monsters have pluggable AI
- Behaviors can be added/removed dynamically
- Priority-based execution
- Reusable across different entity types

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Multi-Client Support

- Create `@mud/client-adapter` interface
- Implement Slack adapter (refactor existing slack-bot)
- Implement Discord adapter
- Implement Web adapter (REST API + WebSocket)

### Phase 3: Enhanced Game Systems

- **Party System Integration**: Wire up database
- **NPC System**: AI-generated dialogue, quests
- **Settlement System**: Towns with NPCs and shops
- **Inventory & Equipment**: Item management
- **Enhanced Combat**: Skills, abilities, equipment bonuses

### Phase 4: Integration

- Refactor `@mud/dm` service to use `@mud/engine`
- Update GraphQL schemas to support parties, NPCs
- Add event listeners for AI description generation
- Update tick service to use behavior system

## How to Use

### Install Dependencies

```bash
cd libs/engine
yarn install
```

### Build

```bash
yarn turbo run build --filter=@mud/engine
```

### Import in Services

```typescript
import { EventBus, PlayerFactory, MonsterFactory, PlayerEntity, RandomMovementBehavior } from '@mud/engine';
```

## Migration Path

The engine is **additive** - it doesn't break existing functionality. Services can gradually adopt:

1. Start emitting events for existing actions
2. Replace direct database calls with factory methods
3. Move AI logic to event listeners
4. Add behaviors to existing monsters/NPCs

## Key Takeaways

✅ **Client-agnostic**: Ready for Discord, Web, or any future client
✅ **Event-driven**: Decoupled, extensible architecture  
✅ **Factory pattern**: Consistent entity management  
✅ **Behavior system**: Pluggable AI for NPCs and monsters  
✅ **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript with strict types  
✅ **Tested patterns**: Inspired by battle-tested RanvierMUD design

**Phase 1 Complete!** The foundation is now in place for a truly modern, scalable MUD engine. 🚀
